Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p><br><hr><br><ul> <li>Source code for this project is available on <a href = "https://github.com/jeffreyshen19/political-cartoon-visualizer" target = "_blank">Github</a>.</li><li>To contribute to, or view the Beyond Words dataset that this project uses, go <a href = "http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/#/" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li><li>To see other projects like this, go <a href = "https://labs.loc.gov/experiments/" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li></ul><br><p> <i>Created by <a href = "http://jeffreyshen.com" target = "_blank">Jeffrey Shen</a> for the Library of Congress Labs.</i></p></div><script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="bower_components/d3/d3.min.js"></script><script src="dist/main-min.js"></script></body></html>
