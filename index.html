Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p><br><!--////////////////////////////////////////////////////--><h2>How to Use This</h2><hr><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

For a more complete picture of how the project was developed, head over to this website's <a href = "https://github.com/jeffreyshen19/political-cartoon-visualizer" target = "_blank">Github</a>.</p><ul> <li>This project was created using the Library of Congress's <a href = "https://www.loc.gov/collections/cartoon-drawings/?fa=online-format:image%7Caccess-restricted:false" target = "_blank">Cartoon Drawings</a> collection. Specifically, the images analyzed were the ones available online and in the Public Domain (meaning before 1923, at the time of this project's creation). </li><li>Duplicate cartoons were removed from the collection. The Library of Congress's dataset contained cartoons which were clearly identical, and had the exact same author, date of creation, and title. These images I removed computationally so as not to skew the results.</li><li>The "subjects" for each image were manually generated by the curators of the Cartoon Drawings collection. </li><li>For the purposes of this data visualization, I did not count certain subjects in my analysis. These tended to be terms like "American" or "Cartoon" which did not tell much about the actual image. For a full list of these "blacklisted" terms, see <a href = "./data/blacklisted-subjects.txt">here</a>. </li><li>I combined the subject "Hill, David B" with "Hill, David" because these terms represented the exact same set of images.</li><li>In the subject selection dropdown, only the subjects with more than 10 occurences are shown.   </li></ul><br><!--////////////////////////////////////////////////////--><h2>Sources and Further Reading</h2><hr><ul> <li>Source code for this project is available on <a href = "https://github.com/jeffreyshen19/political-cartoon-visualizer" target = "_blank">Github</a>.</li><li>To view the dataset that this project uses, go <a href = "https://www.loc.gov/collections/cartoon-drawings/?fa=online-format:image%7Caccess-restricted:false" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li><li>To see other projects like this, go <a href = "https://labs.loc.gov/experiments/" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li></ul><br><p> <i>Created by <a href = "http://jeffreyshen.com" target = "_blank">Jeffrey Shen</a> for the Library of Congress Labs.</i></p></div><script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="bower_components/d3/d3.min.js"></script><script src="dist/main.js"></script></body></html>
